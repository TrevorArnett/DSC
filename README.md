The coding file is a Google Colab notebook of code that goes through my whole analysis on this project and has each step that I did along the way. When this code is downloaded all of the code is written and all you will have to do is run every cell by clicking the play button next to the cell or by clicking cmd + enter on each cell.
The word doc is already typed and you will just have to read the graph and text.
